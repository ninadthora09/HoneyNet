## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pure Node.js Sensors** | SSH honeypot using `ssh2` npm package — no Python runtime needed |
| **Real-Time Attack Feed** | Live updates via Socket.io as attackers probe your systems |
| **Threat Scoring (0-100)** | Automated scoring based on behavior patterns and attempt volume |
| **Attacker Fingerprinting** | Classify as scanner, bruteforce, bot, or human operator |
| **GeoIP Mapping** | Plot attack origins on an interactive world map |
| **Credential Intelligence** | Aggregated table of usernames/passwords attackers are using |
| **Session Replay** | Watch attacker keystrokes in real-time with timing preserved |
| **Per-Attacker Dossier** | Full history per IP — commands, credentials, sessions, timeline |

### 🚨 What You Can Detect

- SSH brute force attempts (`root/root`, `admin/123456`, etc.)
- Path traversal probes (`/.env`, `/wp-login.php`, `/admin`)
- API enumeration (`/api/v1/users`, `/graphql`, `/actuator/env`)
- Command injection attempts in fake shells
- Automated scanners vs human operators
